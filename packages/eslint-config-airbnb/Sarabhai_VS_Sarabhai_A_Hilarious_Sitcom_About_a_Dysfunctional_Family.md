The show revolves around the hilarious conflicts and interactions between Maya Sarabhai, a snobbish and sophisticated socialite, and her daughter-in-law Monisha Sarabhai, a middle-class and simple-minded woman. Maya constantly tries to change Monisha's habits and manners, but Monisha always finds a way to annoy her. Maya's husband Indravadan Sarabhai is a retired businessman who loves to tease his wife and son Rosesh Sarabhai, a poet and actor who is obsessed with his mother. Rosesh's poems are a source of comedy for the show, as they are often absurd and nonsensical. The eldest son Sahil Sarabhai is a cosmetologist who is married to Monisha and tries to balance his loyalty between his wife and his mother. The show also features other supporting characters such as Sonya Sarabhai, a psychic; Dushyant, a technician who explains everything about machines; Ila, Indravadan's sister; Madhusudan, Ila's deaf husband; and Baldev Singh, Monisha's father.
